how to package for PyPI:

edit version number in setup.py
Update CHANGELOG
clean up untracked files with git

$ cd ScopeFoundry
$ python setup.py sdist

(creates a tar.gz file in dist/ScopeFoundry-x.x.x.tar.gz)

Testing:
conda env create -n test_env
source activate test_env

 pip uninstall ScopeFoundry

mkdir ~/test
cp dist/ScopeFoundr-x.x.x.tar.gz ~/test
cd ~/test
tar zxvf ScopeFoundr-x.x.x.tar.gz
cd ScopeFoundry-x.x.x

python setup.py build
python setup.py install

(Upload to PyPI)
(note you can’t upload the same named file more than once, so test locally first!)
conda install twine
twine upload dist/ScopeFoundry-1.0.0.0.tar.gz

Commit Final changes to repo
tag foundry_scope repo “ScopeFoundry_v1.x.x”
Push foundry_scope repo
subtree push ScopeFoundry
tag ScopeFoundry repo “v1.x.x.”
Create a “release” on GitHub including a copy of tar.gz dist file
